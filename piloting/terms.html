         <p class="p" style="text-align: center"><i>last updated june 4, 2025.</i>
         <p class="p"><b>PLEASE READ THROUGH THIS ENTIRE PAGE BEFORE PLACING A PILOTING REQUEST!</b>  by utilizing my piloting services, you are confirming that you have already read, agreed to, and are legally binded to the following.  many frequently asked questions are answered here, but if you have any unaddressed concerns, please feel free to <a href="/contact.html" class="text-link">reach out to me</a>.
			<h2 class="h2">terms of service . . .</h2>
            <p class="p">these terms of service outline the process of hiring 'me' (aerei).  if 'you' (the client) disagree with any part of these terms, please do not use my services.  i reserve the right to modify and update these terms at any time.  your continued patronage and access to my services after modifications have been made indicates your acceptance of these terms.
            <h3 class="h3">1. legal and privacy information . . . </h3>
               <ol class="list">
                  <li>both the client and myself are over 18 and are legally able to adhere to these terms of service, or a legal guardian has agreed to these terms on the client's behalf.</li>
                  <li>you grant me permission to log into the account which you provide log-in information for, and remain logged in until the service is complete, which may take up to several days or weeks.  you can confirm that the account provided to me belongs to you, or that you have express permission from the original owner for the account to be accessed by me.</li>
                  <li>i will frequently update you on any updates i make through your account.  <b>any changes made in your account that do not line up with the updates i send to you are made by someone who is not me.</b></li>
                  <li>i will not respond to any messages sent to your account, nor allow anybody to alter your account (including joining your world) without your permission.</li>
                  <li>by conducting payments through paypal, i will keep your legal and personal information private.  <b>you will also refrain from sharing my legal and personal information to anyone.</b></li>
                  <li>i have the right to reject request, or put you on hold temporarily if circumstances prevent me from finishing your request in a timely manner.  i will provide a 50% refund if personal circumstances prevent me from finishing your request altogether after the service has already begun.</li>
               </ol>
            <h3 class="h3">2. piloting request process . . . </h3>
               <p class="p">to initiate the ordering process, you will <i>fill out the <a href="/piloting.html#orderform" class="text-link">order form</a> found on my website</i> to place a piloting request.  this form documents the official details of the request and is stored indefinitely in my personal drive.</p>
				   <p class="p">upon receiving your request, i will reach out to you approving or denying your order.</i>  after confirming the details and price of your request through private communication, i will set up an invoice for you to pay in full <i>before</i> i start working on your request.
               <p class="p">if you abandon communication with me while i am working on your request, i will attempt to contact you once a week.  if i do not receive any response after these two attempts, <b>i will consider your service abandoned or cancelled, log out of the provided account(s), and no longer resume work.</b></p>
            <h3 class="h3" id="paymentinfo">2a. payment info . . . </h3>
               <p class="p"><b>all payments must be paid in full, and upfront.  all payments are final, no refunds.</b>  payments are made through a paypal invoice with a deadline of 7 days.  you are free to request an extension of this deadline if needed.  all of my prices are listed in USD and will automatically be converted to your local currency through the invoice if you live outside of the U.S.  i do not charge tax.</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                     <li>if i do not receive payment within 1 week of confirming your request and you do not communicate with me that you want your payment deadline extended, <b>i will assume you have cancelled your request and i will not work on it.</b>  you will have to contact me again to resume the service.  there will be no need to submit another form unless you are ordering something entirely different from your original request.
                     <li>payments should not be made outside of my provided paypal invoice.</li>
                     <li>by filing any kind of chargeback against me, i will have the right to refuse service to you going forward.</li>
                  </ul>
               <p class="p">to confirm that you have read the majority of my terms, type the password "spiderweb" in the section of the order form that asks for final comments and concerns.  this acts as a signature indicating that you agree to my terms.  without this, i will deny your commission request.  however, this is not a stopping point.  please continue reading until the end of this document to ensure that you are fully knowledgeable of my terms of service!</p>
               <p class="p">to make my services more accessible, i offer payment methods through alternative currency (such as game currency).  the total value paid through alternative currency must be 1.5x the original price.</b> price conversions, as well as the steps to take in order to transfer these currencies can be found <a href="https://www.notion.so/aerei/list-of-currencies-accepted-for-commissions-891d07cd732c4abb90ea3a088ee3c4ef?pvs=4" class="text-link">on my website.</a> by using this method, you agree to adhere to my provided price conversions, even if the value of these alternative forms of currency are altered over time.</p>
				<h3 class="h3">2b. deliverables . . . </h3>
               <p class="p">upon completion of your order, you will receive final screenshots of confirmations of my overall progress.  these screenshots may be posted publicly as proof of credibility of my services for others to see, with any personal information (your account UID, username, etc.) censored.  if you do not wish for these screenshots to be posted, please let me know before i complete your request.</p>
