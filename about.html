      		<p class="p">once upon a time in san diego, california, my mom popped out a baby with 100% filipino blood running through her veins and i guess that baby turned out to be me.  i had a childhood full of playing video games with friends, pushing myself academically, and pursuing performing arts.</p>
         	<p class="p">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp as a kid growing up alongside the burst of the internet's popularity worldwide, i have always looked up very fondly to youtubers and dreamt of being one myself.  <b>in 2012, i created <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EVOCATIONIST/" class="text-link">my first youtube account</a></b>, only posting (cringe) art speedpaints.  that channel has since been converted into a gaming-centric channel.  <b>in 2017, i created my second youtube account</b>, which currently acts as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/aereii" class="text-link">my primary channel</a> where i post music, art, and gaming videos.  also <b>in 2017 is when i started streaming occasionally on youtube</b>, but it wasn't until 2020, when i started <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa9ike7Y-va1ebW3Km37WgUq3XucH71EG" class="text-link">streaming on twitch</a>, where i took up streaming as a dedicated side hobby.  <b>in late 2020 i earned my affiliate status</b>, which i took advantage of in 2023 to host <b>my first subathon aimed towards <a href="https://rentry.co/maereithon" class="text-link">raising money for mental health research.</a></b> this continues to be a tradition i intend to carry out every may.</p>
            <p class="p">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp i have always been an artist at heart.  i grew up with a love for cartoons and animated digital media in general, and that love continues to this day.  i started my digital art journey in 2012 alongside the creation of my first channel using a trackpad mouse, microsoft paint, and photoshop as my primary means of creation.  <b>in 2018, i began accepting paid commissions</b>, first through the app, <a href="https://highrise.game/catalog/designer-profile/aerei" class="text-link">highrise</a>, then externally through social media.  to this day, i still accept paid commissions for custom digital art, and it is my basically my side hustle.</p>
            <p class="p">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp throughout elementary school, i took piano, guitar, bass, and vocal lessons every week but then stopped around the start of middle school to self teach instead.  throughout all my academic years, i performed in my school's choir, and on certain years, i attended san diego master chorale's invitational honor choir.  <b>around 2016, i started writing my own songs</b>, and around 2018 is when i started posting covers of songs on youtube.  in 2020 i published my first single, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro9GiaLVOTA" class="text-link">arcade</a>, in 2021 i released my second single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=AIGCvhg0sqs" class="text-link">open letter to a friend</a>, and in 2024 i released my third single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlqnXHUARxI" class="text-link">gates of heaven</a>.  i am currently working on a 13 track album titled 'for your consumption.'</p>
            <p class="p">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp in terms of my more personal and professional history, <b>i earned my B.S. in kinesiology in 2024</b>.  throughout college, i worked as an accessible media specialist for my school's disability center, as well as a part time athletic instructor for students with disabilities.  currently, i work as an instructor for a multitude of extracurricular activities for elementary school aged students.
				<p class="p">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp for the majority of my high school experience, i was captain of my school's colorguard team.  in 2024, i was an alternate cast member for elan winterguard in the production "SIX" competing within WGI/WGASC IO class.  in 2025, i was a cast member for SDSU's aztec winterguard in the production "unholy unchained" in WGI/WGASC/WCWG IA class.</p>
            <p class="p">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp if there's anything else you'd like to know about me, i am quite an open book!  feel free to <a href="contact.html" class="text-link">contact me</a> with any questions you may have.</p>
