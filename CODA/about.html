         <p>We believe that every person deserves the chance to live a longer idealized life. That's why CODA started in 2000 as a project aimed to revolutionize mortality, offering new possibilities and opportunities for those seeking to overcome the roadblock of a human’s natural, and very limited, time on Earth. More than 10 years later, we are still committed to extending the expectancy of human life by breaking the barriers between life and death through exodOS, an operating system made with the intention of preserving one’s life even after their physical death.</p>
         <h3 class="h3">Meet The Team</h3>
         <p>After founding CODA in 2000 following years of study in neuroscience, <b>Aether</b>'s perspective on the workings of the human mind reach beyond current published research.  Inspired by the theories of digital immortality, morphogenetic fields, and rebirth, CEO Aether is the embodiment of CODA's vision to combine worldly science with unworldly concepts of life and death.</p>
         <p><b>Ananke</b>, CODA's secondary founder and Chief Medical Officer, is the brains behind the day to day operations done at CODA.</p> 
         <p>CODA's Chief Technical Officer, <b>Hypnos</b>, is largely credited for his work on CODA's first build of exodOS, AEREI.  As the mind who brings CODA's conceptual research and ideas to life, the unmatched skill of Hypnos is nothing short of genius.  Where neuroscience meets medicine, Hypnos makes sure that computer science and engineering can fit perfectly into the spectrum to bring CODA's dream to all.</p>
