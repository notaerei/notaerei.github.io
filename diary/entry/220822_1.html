      <p class="p">GOD today was so long and exhausting. i woke up at 6:30 in the morning but i decided to sleep through my alarm for a little bit only to wake up 15 minutes later. i thought i could get ready quickly and get to the bus stop on time but i guess my brain is still stuck in the mindset that i live two seconds away from the bus stop that i was moving so slow and ended up getting to the bus stop a tiny bit late, but its okay because i caught the 91 soon after. i couldnt recall where the 90 buses stop so i didnt think it stopped on campus (since google maps + the sms lbt bus times didnt say it would) so after a grueling half hour of traffic i decided to

    <p class="p">between a few people. my mind was so numb at this point i couldnt even focus on what prof. <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">██████████</style></small> was saying because i was dead tired from walking and mentally exhausted from all the traffic and the thought of being late. but it was nice to see him again -- i did have him my freshman year and he was a lot taller in person than i imagined. not that he would remember me but i almost wanted to say hi to him when i walked up to his desk to write my name on the sign in sheet, but i didnt.
		<br>&nbsp while i was walking to brotman hall to submit my paperwork for my new job i saw a squirrel and a snail. the squirrel got surprisingly really close to me and the snail was super cute. i wanted to pick it up but then i got worried that i wouldnt know where to put it back down.
		<br>&nbsp as much as i hate waking up so early in the morning sometimes, i also really love it. the weather was just the perfect amount of gloomy and the perfect temperature and the perfect brightness. it felt like a real first day of school, just like all the ones from elementary to
		<br> high school, where i would get to campus ridiculously early and watch
		<br> all the students slowly trickle in and hang out near their
		<br> classes, chatting with each other to shake the grogginess
		<br> off. it reminded me of sitting by the 200 building at <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">████</style></small>
		<br>&nbsp and watching the sun rise.
