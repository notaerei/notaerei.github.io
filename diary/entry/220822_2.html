      <p class="p">lie) and i should be good to go tomorrow when the director representative signs their side of my paperwork. hopefully i can really get started on wednesday. the thought of going to school early and just sitting inside all day is really appealing. its the complete opposite of what i did today, and yes, the series of unfortunate events continues.
			<br>&nbsp after going to the bookstore to get scantrons for biomechanics, i decided to go home and eat lunch. i managed to cook rice in the tiny hot pot my mom gave me two years ago that was meant for my dorm and it worked like a charm! i didnt even have to watch over it that much, it cooked perfectly by itself. it was really nice downtime for such a hectic morning. but then i get thrown right back into it!
			<br>&nbsp i learned my lesson from the morning and left the house way earlier to make it to campus on time despite all the traffic. i ended up getting to class way too early but hey, thats a lot better than being 15 minutes late. i thought this biomechanics lab was going to suck the life out of me

    <p class="p">people carry the conversation because it takes a lot of the pressure off of me to keep talking. overall he was fun to listen to and get to know! im really hoping we can become actual friends over the semester because i know biomechanics is going to be challenging like anatomy was last semester, and i could really use a study buddy or partner or some kind to get me past winter.
		<br>&nbsp my phone was dying really quickly at this point (since i didnt bring my laptop for notes -- i didnt know it was an unwritten rule to always bring your laptop to evrey class??) so i had to rush home instead of waiting for <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">██████</style></small> and <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">██████</style></small> to get off of their classes and drive me home. and as i was taking the 91 i realized a few minutes into the ride that i was going the complete wrong way and had to take another route home (specifically the 173). i think this part of the day was funny because this wasnt my first time making this mistake with the same exact bus.
		<br>&nbsp the 173 route passed by the strawberry stand where <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">████</style></small> bought us strawberries to share. it also passed by the parking complex of my old apartment, and my mind trailed off to the exact walking
		<br> path we took to get to the pergola that we had our first
		<br> kiss under. i looked down and saw i was wearing the exact

			<br> to confess to <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">████</style></small> that i liked him as more than a friend. memory after memory kept replaying in my head -- that first day with <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">████</style></small>, and the days we spent together
