      <p class="p">kid and do not share the same responsibilities as adults do, your suffering is not valid.
			<br>&nbsp obviously thats bullshit and the weight of someones struggles is relative and personal -- what might seem easy to deal with for one person might be the most difficult process for someone else. and to make fun of a kid for not yet having the skills to solve problems out of their league and denying them help is seriously cruel. the only way i was able to get the adults in my life to believe i wasnt just being dramatic was by turning 18, living on my own without financial help from my parents, getting a job, and taking myself to a psychiatrist. i know where my parents are coming from because in their generation, dealing with mental health was very taboo. but it saddens me that i had to go to so many extreme measures throughout the years just to be seen.

		<br>&nbsp this exact time last year, my mom had pushed me beyond my limits that i had run away from home to stay at friends houses, the streets, then finally my dads apartment. i lived away from her with no contact for a month, only coming back home to celebrate thanksgiving which wasnt even pleasant either. i resented her strongly and promised myself that after i moved to long beach i would never come back. but obviously life has its ways of twisting your plans in opposite directions, and now i actually feel a little homesick sometimes, which has NEVER happened to me. to be away from my mom has
