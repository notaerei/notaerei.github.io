      <p class="p">these past few weeks have been a blur... i feel like im living two different versions of my life at the same time, like im phasing in and out of who im supposed to be and what im supposed to be doing. i feel mentally exhausted because of it. not physically tired, i can probably run a mile and feel fine. my brain is just so fried that i lack the ability to comprehend whats even going on most of the time.
			<br>&nbsp on one hand, im feeling really great! im going outside everyday to take a walk, im taking my meds, i eat a full meal every day, i get some chunks of schoolwork done and feel confident about what im learning, i open up to my friends about my feelings and share as much positivity as i can possibly give right now... i dont feel awful about my appearance or my body, i dont hear the barrage of insecure thoughts i usually sense throughout the day.
