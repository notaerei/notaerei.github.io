      <p class="publishinfo">published august 21, 2022</p>
      <p class="p">started my day off with going to gerry's grill with my family and my roommates. it was fun to see my roommates try filipino food for the first time (<small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">██████</style></small> especially really enjoyed it, he literally tried a little bit of everything!) plus i guess it was nice to see my family one last time before they would leave me alone for awhile. we ate really good!! my mom ordered a lot and i was going crazy over the bangus a la pobre as usual. <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">██</style></small> seemed to really like it too which caught me off guard because most non filipinos my age dont find fish appetizing. especially one that was prepared the way gerry's grill made it.

        <p class="p">as a makeshift nightstand. it looks a little awkward in the room because its obviously not meant to be a nightstand but i dont think aesthetics matter as much as practicality. i think its cute if you just ignore the wood colour. <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">██████</style></small> suggested maybe i paint it in the future and i think i might.

    <p class="p">&nbsp my mom also brought me enough food to last seemingly forever, like i dont think ill have to do groceries for about two months (which is nice because im unbelievably broke right now and its going to get worse once i pay my tuition + school supply fees). im actually pretty happy with my food selection this semester — last semester was pretty rough because i was forced to eat instant ramen a million times a week. now i can cook actual pasta or lasagna or poke etc. etc. i can eat REAL FOOD!!
		<br>&nbsp i played minecraft with <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">██</style></small> and <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">██████</style></small> for awhile and died a million times while doing a village raid (bedrock edition is SO janky for no reason. yes im going to blame all my deaths on bedrock edition and not my skill level.) and then we all went mini golfing at this place called golf & stuff. very creative name, i know, but it was actually a pretty nice golf course, especially since we went at night where all the lights were on and there were barely any people there. i lost really horribly but for my second game ever in my lifetime (the last one taking place more than a decade ago) i think i did pretty okay! theo told me i was only 13 over par and i improved drastically after the first few holes.
		<br>&nbsp the entire time i was thinking about <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">████</style></small>. how nice it

        <p class="p">and seeing them together really made me miss <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">████</style></small>. plus i mentioned <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">████</style></small>'s job to <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">██████</style></small> earlier since we were on the subject of her mom working for united airlines, and all day i just really wanted to talk to <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">████</style></small>. i
