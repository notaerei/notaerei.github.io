      <p class="p">moved in on wednesday. the apartment is actually really nice, it seems smaller than <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">███ ██████ ██████████</style></small> but it's not. it has a washer and dryer in unit (which is really awesome) and two bathrooms instead of one (which is even more awesome!) plus theres plenty of space in the living room so i kinda have my own little corner for my desk. overall the apartment reminds me of the one <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">████</style></small> and <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">██████████</style></small> used to have near grossmont college except just more toned down. plus my roommates are pretty cool so far, we've been spending a lot more time together than i anticipated. it's a huge contrast compared to last semester where my roommates and i barely spoke unless absolutely necessary. i know <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">████</style></small> and <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">███████</style></small> hung out sometimes but that was pretty rare still.

    <p class="p">handle everything by myself (i dont know if thats 100 percent true but i know i can make things work one way or another) and she sounded a little doubtful but since i dont live with her anymore, i could care less. i told her i would pry myself away from her so many times, i dont know why shes seems surprised that im actually doing it. i just really hope things actually turn out okay so i dont have to come crawling to her for help. i am very confident i can make it on my own, especially with this job thatll help me get by for now.
		<br>&nbsp speaking of the job, the hiring process is a little wonky. theyre telling me to fill out some paperwork but its got a bunch of financial/tax terms that im unfamiliar with and ive been trying to contact the school's payroll department but theyre super slow with answering. im supposed to start working in a few days so i really hope they can pull through, its really making me anxious.
		<br>&nbsp one last thing: im feeling really weird about my body. its bothering me how big i feel, and i know one of my big goals this semester was to lose weight but im nervous that im going to end up stress eating more often or not exercising often etc. etc. i just want to feel happy in my own skin. i mean i do feel fine, but at the same time i dont. its all so overwhelming...
		<br>&nbsp &nbsp i hope itll all get better with time. ta ta for now,
