		<br>&nbsp today i managed to finish two main rooms of <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">████</style></small>'s base and its looking pretty good even if its mostly unfinished. we were thinking of playing hypixel tomorrow because we've both been on the smp for an ungodly amount of time.

    <p class="p">was in so much pain and it was hard to breathe and even though <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">██████</style></small> and <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">████</style></small> were making me laugh and trying to distract me from the pain, i seriously felt like i was going to throw up and pass out any second. the pain mostly went away eventually but im still really freaked out at how fast life is changing. im scared of how im going to do this semester, im scared i wont be able to support myself, and im scared my mental health could drop so low that i wont make it to the end of this year. the uncertainty in my life is really killing me and i hate it. i genuinely feel like everything would be so much easier to handle if all this break up stuff never happened -- if next week me and <small style="font-family: 'MS Gothic'">████</style></small> would be celebrating four months together.
		<br>&nbsp it's all really sad to think about. i wish things were okay again. may was a month full of bliss, and i wish i could have that back. maybe life would be easier to cope with.
		<br>&nbsp im not super tired but my entire body is in pain (partly from sitting around almost all day and also starting my stretching routine again which is waking up my joints and muscles after two years of barely
		<br> any movement) so im going to take a shower and go to bed.
		<br>&nbsp hopefully things get better,
