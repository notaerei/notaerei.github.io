      <p class="p">can be? what happened to the ash that had the strength to fight back anything that felt wrong?
			<br>&nbsp i often feel weak nowadays. like all the barriers and limits i had have been broken down and all thats left of me is emptiness, as if i spent my entire life building this shell and not bothering to pay attention to what im even protecting in the first place. i feel nothing. i feel like im floating through life, like im the ghost that watches over the residents of a house, like im watching a concert from half a mile outside the venue. i know this illness is interfering with my ability to enjoy life, because i have always been the type of person to say that life is beautiful and should be appreciated. and i still do believe that, i just find myself to be an exception to my own motto somehow. and that really is just... not me.
			<br>&nbsp im trying as hard as i can. im in so much pain that it hurts even to help myself. i wish people would cut all the bullshit about "healing by myself" because im really doing the best i can, but theres a point where i cant be alone anymore. its like trying to stitch up an open wound on my back,

			<br>&nbsp but that presents a whole other problem -- the more desperate i feel when asking for help, the more hopeless and erratic i get, to the point where my thoughts are running so fast that im freaking out because i feel like everything is out of control. like the blood is spilling

    <p class="p">and im trying to thoroughly explain to a person with no medical background on how to deal with the current situation with limited supplies and time. because all i want is the pain to stop now, as soon as possible. i cant seem to wait like i used to be able to.
		<br>&nbsp maybe its because i ran out of patience, or because ive been through so much that waiting feels like another version of being ignored. who knows?
		<br>&nbsp life is beautiful and precious, yet equally devastating and hellish. thats the best way to describe how things have been for me in the last few weeks.
		<br>&nbsp and with that i bid you goodnight for today... im not actually going to sleep yet, im going to get some more schoolwork done and do some more writing and just meditate a little.
