      <p class="p">will say that my mom was abusive and i shouldnt be defending her this much, but trust me, im not trying to defend her bad actions. she was abusive for a majority of my life, but she was (and is still) also kind, caring, and hardworking. no matter how much she has hurt me, i know where shes coming from, and i know she has never purposely meant to make me suffer out of some evil intention. life was just really difficult for her for awhile, and i happened to be caught in the crossfire of her lack of healthy coping mechanisms. but shes older now, and much wiser, and with that comes change. shes changed since i moved out. shes a better person to me now.
			<br>&nbsp this is why i give people so many chances, i think. plenty of people have wronged me in so many ways, and yes, i do have the ability to cut people off at the blink of an eye depending on the situation. but most of the time i strongly believe everyone deserves an opportunity at redemption. as humans, we are constantly changing -- the person i am right now is not

    <p class="p">and care so it can thrive, or letting it die. personally i think every living thing on this world deserves to experience their potential of life to the fullest, so i would keep watering it until it naturally has to go.
		<br>&nbsp its fair to note that sometimes its hard to keep up with a plants growth. sometimes life gets so busy that you forget to water it, or its roots grow so thick and convoluted that things get messy and difficult to deal with. i feel like that shouldnt be an indicator to start giving up. i think that sometimes hard work and dedication is necessary to salvage things the best you can, and in the end, it may be worth it. you end up with a beautiful plant, and the satisfaction of completing such a committed task.
		<br>&nbsp this plant analogy all boils down to this: what is the purpose of my life if not to offer others a chance to enjoy theirs through forgiveness and redemption? does this make me a gullible pushover? or someone sensitive and understanding enough to know how to separate someones actions from who they really are?
