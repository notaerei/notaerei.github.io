      <p>2024 was a year of busying myself so much to the point of exhaustion, creative block, and overall fatigue from art. i often felt that i was only ever able to work on art if it was related to a commission order, or a youtube video. actively participating in artfight this year was a huge accomplishment for me because it was the first time in years i felt i was able to put aside time from my hectic life to focus on making art purely for fun. although i didn't do many art studies this year, i certainly experimented and played with colours, effects, and slight adjustments to my art styles. please enjoy perusing through my few, but fun, pieces from 2024.</p>

  caption: thumbnail for highlights of my kinitopet playthrough, which was initially posted on patreon. for not having picked up a pen for the entire year so far, i am honestly impressed at how the quality of my art has retained, and actually, i think it has gotten a little better somehow with zero practice! that is definitely not how art works, so maybe it is just... returning beginner luck. if that exists.
