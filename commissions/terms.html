         <p class="p" style="text-align: center"><i>last updated january 21, 2025.</i>
         <p class="p"><b>PLEASE READ THROUGH THIS ENTIRE PAGE BEFORE PLACING A COMMISSION ORDER!</b>  by commissioning me, you are confirming that you have already read, agreed to, and are legally binded to the following.  many frequently asked questions are answered here, but if you have any unaddressed concerns, please feel free to <a href="/contact.html" class="text-link">reach out to me</a>.
			<h2 class="h2">terms of service . . .</h2>
            <p class="p">these terms of service outline the process of commissioning 'me' (aerei).  if 'you' (the client) disagree with any part of these terms, please do not use my services.  i reserve the right to modify and update these terms at any time.  your continued patronage and access to my services after modifications have been made indicates your acceptance of these terms.
            <h3 class="h3">1. legal and privacy information . . . </h3>
               <ol class="list">
                  <li>both the client and myself are over 18 and are legally able to adhere to these terms of service, or a legal guardian has agreed to these terms on the client's behalf.</li>
                  <li>you grant me permission to observe and replicate any provided original character designs and reference materials in good faith.  to my knowledge, any references provided by you are completely original and/or copyright free.  <i>the work i produce will be completely original</i>, and will not utilize copyrighted or unauthorized material.</li>
                  <li>the details of the commission, including your provided name and any provided reference photos (with the exception of any photos of real life people, which will be kept private) will be posted on my public <a href="https://aerei.notion.site/o-o-2a641b986f22430b8a95ddcaad921b5c?pvs=4" class="text-link">to-do list</a>.</li>
                  <li>by conducting payments through paypal, i will keep your legal and personal information private.  <b>you will also refrain from sharing my legal and personal information to anyone.</b></li>
                  <li>i have the right to reject any commission or request, or put you on hold temporarily if circumstances prevent me from finishing your order in a timely manner.  i will provide a 50% refund if personal circumstances prevent me from finishing your order altogether after work has already begun.</li>
               </ol>
            <h3 class="h3">2. commission ordering process . . . </h3>
               <p class="p">first, <b>you must have references already prepared</b> through links before you fill out an order form.  i will accept reference sheets and written descriptions, but i will not come up with huge ideas from scratch for you without an additional negotiable charge.  i will not drastically change my art style to look like someone else's, nor will i knowingly copy ideas, so all my work will have my own personal spin put upon it.  my art style <i>must</i> be kept in mind before commissioning me.
               <p class="p">to initiate the ordering process, you will <i>fill out the <a href="/commissions.html#orderform" class="text-link">order form</a> found on my website</i> to place a commission request.  this form documents the official details of the request and is stored indefinitely in my personal drive.</p>
				   <p class="p">upon receiving your request, i will reach out to you approving or denying your order.</i>  after confirming the details and price of your commission through private communication, i will set up an invoice for you to pay in full <i>before</i> i start working on your request.  the information provided through the order form will be posted on my public <a href="https://aerei.notion.site/o-o-2a641b986f22430b8a95ddcaad921b5c?pvs=4" class="text-link">to-do list</a>.  any extra relevant details about the request provided through private communication will also be added to my to-do list.</p>
               <p class="p">my work process is broken down into two steps: the <i>"just started/rough sketch"</i> phase, where you are able to suggest changes and provide as much feedback as you want, then the <i>"halfway done"</i> phase and onwards, where i will not allow any further major edits unless it's related to colour.</p>
               <p class="p">when approximately half of the work has been done, i will provide you with an estimate of the date of completion.  if i am unable to deliver the product on that provided date, i will provide you with a new estimation of a completion date.  i will deliver the final product when the work is fully completed.  if you indicate in your order form that you must receive the product by a specific date, and i do not deliver on time, i will offer you a significant discount on any future orders you make with me.</p>
               <p class="p">if you abandon communication with me while i am working on your commission, i will attempt to contact you once a week.  if i do not receive any response after these two attempts, <b>i will consider the project abandoned or cancelled, and will no longer resume work.</b></p>
            <h3 class="h3" id="paymentinfo">2a. payment info . . . </h3>
               <p class="p"><b>all payments must be paid in full, and upfront.  all payments are final, no refunds.</b>  payments are made through a paypal invoice with a deadline of 7 days.  you are free to request an extension of this deadline if needed.  all of my prices are listed in USD and will automatically be converted to your local currency through the invoice if you live outside of the U.S.  i do not charge tax.</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                     <li>if i do not receive payment within 1 week of confirming your request and you do not communicate with me that you want your payment deadline extended, <b>i will assume you have cancelled your request and i will not work on it.</b>  you will have to contact me again to resume the commission process.  there will be no need to submit another form unless you are commissioning me for something entirely different from your original request.
                     <li>commission payments should not be made outside of my provided paypal invoice.</li>
                     <li>by filing any kind of chargeback against me, your rights of usage to my work will be retracted.  i will have the right to refuse service to you going forward.</li>
                  </ul>
               <p class="p">to confirm that you have read the majority of my terms, type the password "spiderweb" in the section of the order form that asks for final comments and concerns.  this acts as a signature indicating that you agree to my terms.  without this, i will deny your commission request.  however, this is not a stopping point.  please continue reading until the end of this document to ensure that you are fully knowledgeable of my terms of service!</p>
               <p class="p">to make my art more accessible, i offer payment methods through alternative currency (such as game currency).  the total value paid through alternative currency must be 1.5x the original commission price.</b> price conversions, as well as the steps to take in order to transfer these currencies can be found <a href="https://www.notion.so/aerei/list-of-currencies-accepted-for-commissions-891d07cd732c4abb90ea3a088ee3c4ef?pvs=4" class="text-link">on my website.</a> by using this method, you agree to adhere to my provided price conversions, even if the value of these alternative forms of currency are altered over time.</p>
               <p class="p">loyalty points ('stars') can be used to apply discounts to final prices.  you are able to accumulate stars only by submitting orders without using your existing stars.  stars can only be used and applied in specified increments on my website.  upon completion of the service, your provided name along with the number of stars you possess will be listed on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DSMcTAHSbKTI_AYAdkflvvj-EXwNUXkcn5WlwamBvC8/edit#gid=0" class="text-link">my public database.</a></p>
				<h3 class="h3">2b. deliverables . . . </h3>
               <p class="p">upon completion of your order, you will receive a private google drive folder to download the finished product at the highest quality possible.  you are free to share this folder publicly upon receiving it.</p>
        			   <ul class="list">
           			   <li>all files are rendered in .png.  i will convert the finished product to any different file types by request, with the exception of .pdf, .sai, or .kra files.</li>
                     <li>if separated assets of my work are needed for rigging, you <i>must</i> discuss this with me <i>before</i> i start working on the commission.</li>
           				<li>canvas sizes depend on the request.  i will change the canvas to any size by request <i>before</i> the halfway point of my working process.  for reference, however, my typical canvas sizes are listed below.</li>
        			   </ul>
        			<table style="width: 700px">
