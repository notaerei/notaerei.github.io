					<li><b>i will not change my art style to look like someone else's nor will i blatantly copy ideas.</b> if you want me to take heavy inspiration from something, please know i will likely put my own spin on it to make it more original to avoid copyright infringement. keep my art style in mind before commissioning me.

            <p class="p">when filling out an order form for your next commission, you can mention that you want to use your star(s) to get a discount on the final price. if you're unsure how many stars you have, check <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DSMcTAHSbKTI_AYAdkflvvj-EXwNUXkcn5WlwamBvC8/edit#gid=0">this list!</a>

            <p class="p"><b>you will not get stars from the commission you are using your stars on.</b> in order to build up stars, you will have to buy a commission <i>without</i> using your stars. you also do not have to use all of your stars immediately. you can save them for as long as you want!
        <h3 class="h3">discount shop . . .</h3>
        <p class="p">please note <b>you can only use stars based on these listed increments.</b> (ie. if you have 2 stars, you can't use both stars at the same time. you can only use 1.) the maximum number of stars you can use at one time is 15.
